        "Graphs are one of the most common data structure that you'll encounter in your computer science journey. These structures can model many real-world problems. You'll study and implement graphs in such courses as CPSC 223, 323, and 365.\n",

        "\n",
        "A graph is a structure that comprises a set of vertices and a set of edges. This is best explained through a picture. \n",

        "![your first graph](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/not-reachable.jpg)\n",
        "\n",
        "The *vertices* (also called *nodes*) are the circles labeled with numbers. The *edges* are the lines that connect the vertices. We could say that this graph has the set of vertices, *V*, and a set of edges, *E*, such that:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "V = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 }\n",

        "###**Paths**\n",
        "\n",
        "A *path* in a graph is a sequence of vertices, where each vertex is connected to the next by an edge. One path in the above graph is:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "0 -> 1 -> 2\n",

        "0 -> 2\n",
        "```\n",
        "We can also say that this graph has no path between nodes 0 and 4, as there is no sequence of edges that connect them.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process of identifying the sequence of nodes and edges that connect two nodes in a graph is called *pathfinding*. This is a robust field of computer science and mathematics (and an extremely frequent job interview topic), and it will be your focus for the rest of this problem set.\n",
        "\n",
        "###**Graph Attributes**\n",

        "There are many different terms we can use to describe a graph. Some important ones for you to know are *connected*, *cyclic*, and *directed*. \n",
        "\n",
        "A **Connected Graph** is a graph in which there is path between any two vertices in the graph. In other words, every vertex is reachable from every other vertex by following some sequence of edges. The example above is not connected, as there are vertices (such as 0 and 4, or 1 and 3, among others) that are not reachable from one another. We call this a **disconnected** graph. Let's look at a new example.\n",

In a connected graph, even the non-neighboring nodes are reachable from one another. How many paths can you find from node 0 to 2?\n",
        "\n",
        "A **Cyclic Graph** is a graph that contains a path that starts and ends with the same vertex and in which no vertex appears more than once (except for the first and last one). The example above contains multiple cycles. One of them is\n",

        "\n",
        "You'll observe that there is no cycle in this graph. There's no way to choose a start vertex and form a path that leads back to it. We call this an **acyclic** graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "A **Directed Graph** is a graph in which the edges have a direction associated with them. Each edge connects two vertices, but has a specified direction that indicates which vertex is the **source** and which vertex is the **destination**. When we draw graphs, we use arrows to indicate direction. \n",

        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0\n",
        "```\n",

In other words, Mark Zuckerberg is friends with John Carmack if and only if John Carmack is friends with Mark Zuckerberg. With this in mind, what kind of graph would be appropriate to model Facebook friendships? What about for Instagram, where Mark can follow John without John following Mark too?\n",
